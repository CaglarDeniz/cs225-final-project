## Communication
### Team meetings
We will meet once per week on Wednesday evenings through a Discord voice/video call. We will designate one person to be coding and sharing their screen to the others while we all work together. This role will rotate each week.
### Assistance
Discord is the best place as we all have each other on the  group chat. Responding within the day should be fine. If the message seems urgent, please respond as soon as you can.
Respect
We will get everyone's opinions in team oriented decisions and will not rule out anyoneâ€™s opinions. We will ask if everyone is in agreement before taking any action. 

## Collaboration
### Work Distribution
Based on the components needed for the projects, the components can be distributed evenly for each member. For example if there are eight components and we have four members, each member would have two components for their share of work. If there are any unexpected complications of unforeseen work, we will find a way to delegate these tasks fairly and appropriately. 
### Time Commitment
Three hours of work per week seems like a reasonable number of hours of work expected from each member. To ensure that no one person takes on too much or too little work we will report on our progress each week that we meet. From there we can assess how to redistribute any work if necessary.
### Conflict Resolution
For any small conflicts we will resolve them by simply voting on it as a group. For ties we will flip a coin. If one or more members have not accomplished their tasks, we will listen to his reasoning for why this task is not complete and will judge from there. For instance if someone has external issues affecting his contribution to the project, the rest of the members will try to take some of the workload off him until he can cope with the external issues.
