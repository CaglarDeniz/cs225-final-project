# Weekly-log
## Week (4/12-4/18)
+ This week we did not do too much coding. Most of it was just planning out the skeleton of the code and we also implemented the skeleton. 
+ We just laid out what classes we needed and some variables and possible functions but we did not fully implement them.
+ We started working on reading the data from the file. 
## Week (4/19-4/25)
+ This week we mostly did everything as a group where we all hopped on a call and a designated person would type out the code and the rest of us chipped in our opinions and ideas on the necessary classes and implementations we needed. 
+ Created the skeleton for all the necessary classes such as the graph class. We were able to parse our data successfully this week as well.
## Week (4/26-5/2)
+ This week Kevin and Miguel implemented most of the BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm and were able to test BFS successfully but Dijkstra’s was not fully tested.
+ Deniz and Deepak wrote a tentative framework for their implementation of SCC, deciding to go with Tarjan’s algorithm.
+ Some issues were left to be dealt with for SCC.
## Week (5/3-5/12)
+ This week Miguel and Kevin worked on writing more comprehensive tests for our BFS implementation.
+ We also finished up writing Dijkstra’s and moved on to writing and finishing comprehensive testing.
+ Both BFS and Dijkstra’s are fully functional.
+ Miguel and Kevin also started and finished the rating prediction algorithm (made using Dijkstra’s).
+ Wrote tests to verify that it works. Deniz and Deepak completely finished the Tarjan’s algorithm and wrote up tests for them.
+ Collectively worked on the README, Written Report, and 10 min video.
